This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the catch-all route ('*') in React Router Dom v6.  The problem arises when the catch-all route is not correctly handling requests to non-existent paths, resulting in unexpected behavior or errors.

The `App.js` file contains the buggy code, while `AppSolution.js` provides a corrected implementation.
